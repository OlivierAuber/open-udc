Each UDC node should have a dedicated irc channel.

Name of the irc channel should indicate its position in the node tree and should be preficed "udc." to indicate it follow this specification.

(For exemple the root node of the test and developpement currency named "dev" use the channel ##udc.dev on freenode irc network.)

This channel should be moderate because only accepted children can send or receive money in the node and so need to send command in the irc channel (mode +v).
Only accountant childrens should be moderator of the channels.

Children that has high-availabilty (almost always connected) and enough good bandwith (ADSL or higher) can ask to be accountant of the node.
A accountant have to verify and sign each transaction that happen on the node (and so on the irc channel).
That means the accountants hold and synchronize the money repartition of the node. 
The minimum number of accountant signatures to valid a transaction is one of the Node Parameters.
Node Parameters are also stored by accountant database and must be signed by almost all children of the node.

Any children is also able to create its own children node, but it is not recomended if you have only one computer that could make server to this node.

UCD protocol define the following commands :

 - HELP
 - INFO
 - SUSCRIBE
 - UPDATE
 - SEND
 - CONFIRMATION
 - DUMP
 - WHEREIS
 - EXCHANGE
 - MARK
 - RESET
 - MERGE
 - SPLIT

Node name are case insensitive and have to use charset [0-9A-Za-z_-].
As, on freenode irc network, maximum lenght of channel name is about 48 characters and the maximum lenght of nick is 16 characters, we recommend to limit Node name to 8 characters.
UDC protocol define the reserved node name :

 - "fund"  is reserved for the default children node. It can NOT have any children, but could be use to collect taxes (if any).
 - "reset" should be reserved for responding to the RESET MARK MERGE and SPLIT commands. It can NOT have any children, NEITHER store any money.

Alias children name MAY be allowed by a Node.

Node MIGHT forbid any children to have the same name as him (its parent).

The "\" charaters is used to identifie several accountant of a children node. For exemple nick fra\Paris and fra\05 on a channel indicate that node "Paris" and "05" are both acountant of the children node fra.


Description of the commands :

 - HELP (mandatory)

 Without any argument it MUST list the available command accepted by a bot. In other case it must the describe the command passed as its first argument.

  Eg, To show help about suscribing :
  /msg ubot help suscribe
