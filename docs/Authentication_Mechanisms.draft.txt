1.== Introduction ==

  The Open-UDC project aims to provide a open, democratic and secure
  monetary system, compatible with universal dividende.

  This document describe the authentication mechanisms used in the
  Open-UDC implementations.

  This document also describe how to use the OpenPGP standard [RFC4880]
  in order to conform to the Open-UDC specifications.

2.== Conventions Used in This Document ==

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.== OpenPGP certificate ==

  Open-UDC use widely OpenPGP standards for all authentications.

  An Open-UDC certificate is an OpenPGP certificate on which the comment
  field of one of its uid MUST be a special string.

  As the Open-UDC characterization only use uid in an OpenPGP certifcate
  it is more accurate to speak about Open-UDC uid (inside an OpenPGP
  certificate) instead of Open-UDC certificate.

  The special string recognized by Open-UDC implementation is a sum of
  fields which MUST be separated by a semicolon ';'.
  Each field MAY contain multiple subfields separated by a comma ','.

  The back-slash character '\' MAY also be use as a special character to
  escape the semicolon, the comma and itself.

  The string MUST use only US-ASCII charset.

  First field act as an header which specify the meaning of its
  following fields.

  Open-UDC specifies the 3 following headers in uid comment :

    - "udid1"
            Used for Human Authentication.
    - "udnode1"
            Used for Node Authentication.
    - "udcinit"
            Used for the initialization of udc-unit signing chain.
    - "udcsource" 
            Used to create the udc-units.

  The charaters after the last recognized field in the string SHOULD be
  ignored and MAY use other charset (like UTF-8). They MAY be use to add
  informations in a non-universal language.

  
3.== Human Authentication ==

  Each human which want to use an Open-UDC currency and receive a
  Universal Dividende (or an other basic income) MUST have a OpenPGP
  certificate in accordance with the following specification.  

3.1.= OpenPGP Human certificate =


    This string look like :

  udid1;Brucker;Jean-Jacques,Pascal;1297787885;45.433 4.434; 

3.1.1. Universal Digital IDentity


3.2= Proof of identity =
