1.== Introduction ==

  The Open-UDC project aims to provide a open, democratic and secure
  monetary system, compatible with universal dividende.

  This document describe the authentication mechanisms used in the
  Open-UDC implementations.

  This document also describe how to use the OpenPGP standard [RFC4880]
  in order to conform to the Open-UDC specifications.

2.== Conventions Used in This Document ==

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.== Using OpenPGP certificates ==

3.1= specific uid =

  Open-UDC use widely OpenPGP standards for all authentications.

  An Open-UDC certificate is an OpenPGP certificate on which the comment
  field of one of its uid MUST begin with a special string.

  As the Open-UDC characterization only use uid in an OpenPGP certifcate
  it is more accurate to speak about Open-UDC uid (inside an OpenPGP
  certificate) instead of Open-UDC certificate.

  The special string recognized by Open-UDC implementations is a sum of
  fields which MUST be separated by a semicolon ';'.
  Each field MAY contain multiple subfields separated by a comma ','.

  The string MUST use only US-ASCII charset (without the comma and the 
  semicolon which are reserved for separation of fields).

  First field (a.k.a. header field) indicate the meaning and the number
  of its following fields.

  Open-UDC specifies the 4 following headers field in uid comment :

    - "udid1"
            Used for Human Authentication.
    - "udnode1"
            Used for Node Authentication.
    - "udcinit"
            Used for the initialization of udc-unit signing chain.
    - "udcsource" 
            Used to create the udc-units.

  The charaters after the last recognized field in the string SHOULD be
  ignored and MAY use other charset (UTF-8...). They MAY be use to add
  informations in a non-universal language.

3.3= signing policy=

3.4= exporting     

  
4.== Human Authentication ==

  Each human which want to use an Open-UDC currency and receive a
  Universal Dividende (or an other basic income) MUST have a OpenPGP
  certificate in accordance with the following specification.  

4.1.= OpenPGP Human certificate =


    This string look like :

  udid1;Brucker;Jean-Jacques,Pascal;1297787885;45.433 4.434; 

  The main key of the certificate should expired in less than 11 years after its creation.

4.1.1. Universal Digital IDentity


4.2= Proof of identity =
