1.== Introduction ==

  The OpenUDC project aims to provide a open, democratic and secure
  monetary system, compatible with universal dividende.

  This document describe the authentication mechanisms used in the
  OpenUDC implementations.

  This document also describe how to use the OpenPGP standard [RFC4880]
  in order to conform to the OpenUDC specifications.

2.== Conventions Used in This Document ==

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.== Using OpenPGP certificates ==

3.1= specific uid =

  OpenUDC use widely OpenPGP standards for all authentications.

  An OpenUDC certificate is an OpenPGP certificate on which the comment
  field of one of its uid begin with the special string know as "udid2". 

  As the OpenUDC characterization only use uid in an OpenPGP certifcate
  it is more accurate to speak about OpenUDC uid (inside an OpenPGP
  certificate) instead of OpenUDC certificate.

  The special string recognized by OpenUDC implementations is a sum of
  fields which MUST be separated by a semicolon ';'.
  Each field MAY contain multiple subfields separated by a comma ','.

  The string MUST use only US-ASCII charset (without the comma and the 
  semicolon which are reserved for separation of fields).

  The string size MUST NOT exceed 255 octets.

  First field (a.k.a. header field) indicate the meaning and the number
  of its following fields.

  OpenUDC specifies the 3 following headers field in uid comment :

    - "udid1"
            Was used for Human Authentication, now deprecated.
    - "udid2"
            Used for Human Authentication.
    - "udcini1"
            Used for the initialization of udc-unit signing chain.
    - "udnode1"
            Used for Node Authentication.

  The charaters after the last recognized field in the string SHOULD be
  ignored and MAY use other charset (UTF-8...). They MAY be use to add
  informations in a non-universal language.

3.2= Key Types =

    We recommended to use a big main key of for the OpenPGP certificate,
    and at least 2 subkeys in it : 
    - 1 for encryption.
    - at least one for signing udc-unit signing chain. As smallest key
      implie smallest signature, it is recommended to use ECC Keys.

3.3= Exporting =

    Certificates MUST be exported to some well-know sks key servers.

    Sks servers MAY be enhanced to register only OpenUDC certificate,
    and to unregister automatically OpenUDC certificate wich are not
    validated periodically by some other certificate.

3.4= Expiration =
 
    The main key of the OpenPGP certificate should expired in less than
    11 years after its creation.

4.== Human Authentication ==

  Each human which want to use an OpenUDC currency and receive a
  Universal Dividende (or an other basic income) MUST have a OpenPGP
  certificate in accordance with the following specification.  

4.1.= OpenUDC Unique identification string =

    An OpenUDC user MUST have a special string in the comment of one
    of its OpenPGP uid.

    This strings look like :
    
    udid2;c;Brucker;Jean-Jacques,Pascal;1980-12-05;E,+45.43+004.43;

    or :

    udid2;h;063007a34f7c8991ad47fe988e6d00c467162ae86508faaf8e4c97626880574c;

4.1.1. Universal Digital IDentity string version 1.


    The "udid1;" header MUST be followed by 4 fields which MUST define :

        1- The last names of the individual, separated by a comma.

        2- The fornames of the individual, separated by a comma.

        3- The date of birth, formated as number of seconds since
           00:00:00 UTC on Thursday, 1 January 1970.
           For people born before this date, the string will indicate a
           negative number prefixed with a charater '-'.
           If the hour of birth is unknow, it SHOULD be fixed at 
           12:00:00 UTC.

        4- The location of birth, defined as terrestrial coordinates.
           The first number MUST be the latitude and MUST be prefixed by
           'N' or '+' if in the Northern hemispheres, and prefixed by 
           'S' or '-' if in the Southern hemispheres.
           The second number MUST be the longitude and MUST be prefixed
           by 'E' or '+' in the east from the Greenwich meridian, and
           by 'W' or '-' in the west from the Greenwich meridian.

           Latitude and longitude MUST have at least 1 digit after the
           decimal point, and at most 6 digits after the decimal point.

           Accepted range for latitude is [-90.0;+90.0].
           Accepted range for longitude is [-179.999999;+180.0].

           Second subfield is optionnal and may be use to define
           non-terrestrial birth.

    Note: The version 1 is deprecated and should not be used anymore.

4.1.2. Universal Digital IDentity string version 2.

    The "udid2;" header MUST be followed by a one-char field which
    define if the birth datas are in clear or hashed :
        - 'c' char means the data are not hashed.
        - 'h' char means the data are hashed.

    The hashed version is obtained by applying the SHA-256 algorithm on
    the clear version.

    As we can know hash the udid we have no more place for fuzziness in
    it, and the rules of the clear version are very strict :

    The clear version "udid2;c;" MUST be followed by 3 fields:

        1- The name(s) as written on the birth certificate. Only
           26 upper case US-ASCII characters are allowed. That means
           it (they) have to be transposed in a standardized way to
           US-ASCII characters.

           If US-ASCII transposed name(s) reach the 26-chars limit,
           extra characters are ignored.

        - The fornames

        2- The date of birth as written on the birth certificate, but
           transposed, as specified by the ISO-8601, in the form:
           "aaaa-mm-dd".

        3- The location of birth

            eg : "DE LA HAUTE TOUR PERDU DANS LA FORET"

4.2= Proof of identity =

    The identity is trusted by using the OpenPGP web of trust.

5.== Node Authentication ==
